### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an advocate of writing maintainable, extensible, readable and simple code. It's a challenge.
I am passionate about open source having led 3 open source projects with more than 2500 github stars. 
[Angularspree](https://github.com/aviabird/angularspree), [Aviacommerce](https://www.aviacommerce.org/), [Gringotts](https://github.com/aviabird/gringotts)

Aspiring blockchain, smart contracts developer. I recently did a course on smart contracts by [Patrick collins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M576WGiDBdQ). Learned a lot from him and [WhiteBoard Crypto](https://www.youtube.com/c/WhiteboardCrypto). I feel I am ready for the crazy world of crypto and Web3.

Security is a major concern in this rather new space. I am writing a book on Web3 security and best practices. The first version of the book will be out by 2nd Oct 2022. 

Chainlink is super cool. 
Stablecoins aren't _that_ stable.
Defi is groundbreaking but will take more time and mistakes before going mainstream.
